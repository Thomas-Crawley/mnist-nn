# mnist-nn
A simple neural network built from scratch to classify handwritten digits.

This repository is purely for the purpose of improving and demonstrating my own understanding of the fundamentals of neural networks and deep learning. The code is based upon the exercises in *Neural Networks and Deep Learning* by Michael Nielsen, available at http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/. I have modified the code slightly for my own understanding. The repository contains a copy of the MNIST database of handwritten digits, retrieved from Michael Nielsen's GitHub repository: https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning.
